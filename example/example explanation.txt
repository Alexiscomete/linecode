 --- GOAL OF THE CODE ---

The code used in the example is used to found the discriminant and the solutions of a second-degree polynomial function




 --- MATHEMATICAL REMINDERS ---

A second-degree polynomial function is function in the form f(x) = ax² + bx + c
 (the example code ask the values of a, b and c)

The discriminant (or Δ) is the number equal to b²-4ac
 (the code calculate this number)

The solution of the equation f(x) = 0 have zero, one or two solutions:

If Δ > 0:
 - the equation have two solutions (-b-√Δ)/2a and (-b+√Δ)/2a

If Δ = 0:
 - the equation juste have one solution -b/2a

If Δ < 0:
 - the equation don't have any solution




 --- PYTHON EQUIVALENT PROGRAM ---


a = int(input("a ?")
b = int(input("b ?")
c = int(input("c ?")

delta = b**2-4*a*c

print("∆ =", delta)

if delta > 0:
  print("x1 =", (-b-delta**0.5)/2a )
  print("x2 =", (-b+delta**0.5)/2a )
if delta == 0:
  print("x =", -b/2a )
if delta < 0:
  print("aucune solution")
